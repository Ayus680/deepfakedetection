Deepfake Detection Using Explainable AI (XAI)
The rapid advancement of deepfake technology poses significant challenges to digital media
integrity, with potential threats spanning from misinformation to identity fraud. 
While deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in detecting deepfakes, their
inherent black-box nature raises concerns regarding trust, interpretability, and real-world
deployment. 
In this study, we explore the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the
transparency and reliability of deepfake detection models. 
By leveraging interpretability methods such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local
Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation
Mapping), 
we aim to provide insights into model decision-making processes. 
Our approach evaluates the performance of popular deepfake detection models, including
CNN-based and transformer-based architectures, across benchmark datasets such as
FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF. 
The results of this study contribute to the development of more trustworthy and accountable AI
systems for deepfake detection, ensuring robustness against adversarial manipulations and
improving user confidence in AI-driven solutions. 
Future work will focus on optimizing the explainability-performance trade-off and deploying
interpretable models in real-world applications.
